that was accepted to CADE'23.
 
  * Check our [main site](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/verifit/tools/afa-comparison/) for more information,
    updates and many more.
  * [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05064): preprint of our paper.
  * For more recent version of our paper, either check the official [CADE'23](https://easyconferences.eu/cade2023/) submission or newer version in the arXiv
  * [Replication package](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/verifit/tools/automata-bench.ova): A virtual machine for replication of our results
    * The replication package is in `.ova` format and needs to be imported in some virtual image manager (see, e.g., [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).
    * The replication packages occupies about 10GB of data.</li>
  * [Benchmarks](https://github.com/VeriFIT/automata-bench): source benchmarks that were used in the comparison.
  * [Benchmarks (mirror)](https://pajda.fit.vutbr.cz/ifiedortom/afa-comparison-benchmarks): mirror of source benchmarks that were used in the comparison.
    * Cloning our benchmarks from this mirror requires <code>git-lfs</code> support (see [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/))
    * Note that the benchmarks are quite extensive and occupies more than 10GB of storage.
